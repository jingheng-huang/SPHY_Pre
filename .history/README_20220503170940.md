(outlets shold be created after the rivernetwork)
In basin delination. If the basin boundary is not correct. 

Try move the oulets to the rivernetwork(The river network will be generated automatically by the prePorcessor) **
If not work, then changing the resolution, no need to exaltly int like 1000, 500 or *** **
Do not choose to wide extent, otherwise you will get wrong basin boundary!

*-----------------------[forcing]

Make sure the units is mm for precipitation, and Degrees Celsius for temperature !! if not, change the code in forcing.py.
   
Only accept the tiff input for the dem. Since the process of convertion NC to tiff would has some problem if you use the gdal in the QGIS. 

*-----------------------[Glacier]

Must be clip to the extent
